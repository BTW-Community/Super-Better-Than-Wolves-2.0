From the changelog:
SBTW VERSION 2.0
Started August 8, 2022
Switched to BETA 2.0 on July 12, 2023

2.1 Hotfix:
-Added some files that were forgotten initially. This fixes a crash related to rendering baskets!

Additions:

-TEMPORARY OMISSION for BETA 2.0: Biome decorator places standard gourds with vanilla seeds/plants

    @ the request of Wario-Luigi Hybrid

-Added SLEEPING!

   Like in Arminias mod/CE 1.4, the world is simulated during sleep. Time is not skipped! Monsters still lurk outside...

-Added Hardcore Soaked!

-Added the bedroll from CE 1.4. You can sleep on this! Great for camping trips.

   Three recipes: wool knit + wool knit + string OR unknit wool OR two feathers

-Added the ability to pick up torches and bricks by right clicking them. No more fumbling!

-Added 9 new seeds for each type of pumpkin and melon WOW!

-Added new item: Bucket of Mortar

   right click to apply mortar to a block, depletes contents of bucket (16 uses)

-Added new tool: the trowel

   right click to apply mortar from your inventory

-Added new block: Wet Mud Bricks

   Can be dried in the sun or baked in a kiln to produce bricks more efficiently than with clay balls alone

-Added more efficient recipes for tanned leather armor

   crafted using cut tanned leather in the 2x2 crafting grid, like untanned leather

-Added rib cracking: use a sharp axe to quickly get meat off a rib

   the rib itself is reduced to bonemeal in the process

-Added the ability to cure ribs with nitre

-Added the Time Cube to the creative menu (WARNING: I am not responsible for any corruption that temporal shenanigans unleash upon your world)

-Added lava and powered axle to creative menu

Changes/Fixes:

-Changed wolves to breed to produce untamed puppies. This opens up some options :)

-Changed the ender goggle overlay to be transparent in places so you can see somewhat while wearing them

-Changed pumpkin seeds to stack to 64 rather than 16 for storage and automation purposes OH NO MY INVENTORY BALANCE!!!!!!!!

-Changed pumpkin and melon varieties to grow by seed rather than biome.
EX: a yellow pumpkin requires a yellow pumpkin seed to grow.

-Changed gourds on the vine to take a few days to mature (like wheat) (rather than being random)

-Changed the ender spectacle overlay to be easier to see through

-Changed wicker baskets to recycle into 3 wicker rather than just 1

-Changed rib bones to be grindable in millstone to produce 6 bonemeal

-Changed the bone club to be grindable in a millstone to produce 2 bonemeal. Hardcore Recycling!

-Changed dead bushes to be a little tougher and made some more bountiful than others

-Changed FCAddOn to no longer display a V next to version number when loading into a world.. for pretty much no reason

-Fixed the lighting bug that caused hampers and such to look completely pitch black (thanks Dawn, Hiracho, and the CE team!!!)

-Fixed a game bricking bug that created a ticking tile entity or something when using a piston shovel to pick up ash.

-Fixed an issue in which the vase was also a Time Cube

-Fixed a quirk where ribs looked kind of buggy to eat. That was my attempt at making them take longer to chew, but it looked sort of dumb
