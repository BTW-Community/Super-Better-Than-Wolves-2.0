- Why Better Than Wolves?
1. How to Beat BTW


---
Do not categorize my ages. They are arbitrary. Give the impression of gradual progress, mark important moments only by material milestones, like first string, first oven. Make each feel like a reach, like you are trying hard. Basically, get into the mindset of somebody that doesn't know anything about Minecraft, someone that is just picking up BTW as a game.

Threats:
Zombie: 

Burns in sunlight.

A brute, but don't underestimate his ability to navigate complicated terrain. Unlike the clever skeleton, zombies lack discretion. They will willingly risk burning to death in order to get the kill. They will not attempt to evade your attacks either.

Speed is not a zombie's strong suit. They are tenacious, however, and can be dangerous in numbers. Fighting large numbers of these things will degrade your weapon durability rapidly. It is possible that, while fending off a surprise horde of zombies in a cramped cave, you might run out of things to hit them with! As with any mob, it is not a good idea to let them get the drop on you.

Zombies also pose an indirect but more sinister threat to your survival: they will kill and eat any animals they come across as during their aimless wanderings. This means that zombies will passively sap your food supply during the night.

!Use your tools!
In the harsh world of Better Than Wolves, players need to exploit every advantage they can get! When a zombie drops an iron tool, don't be afraid to use it. Your first instinct may be to store them away for later use, but they can be the deciding factor in a life or death situation.





-Oven-
Say goodbye to those finicky campfires, because you won't be needing them anymore. The oven

Don't just place your new oven down willy nilly! They are impossible to pick up again after installation, so we must be thoughtful about where we put it.

It's time to settle.

***Surviving in The Forest***

-wolf culling-

The sad reality of forest life is that you can't have your wolves and eat them too. If you let them go unmanaged too long, they will deplete the land of wildlife and eventually turn on you. A hungry wolf is one of the most dangerous foes in the game, so it is better to deal with them before they become a problem. Never attack a pack of wolves unless you have a two block high vantage point, as ever member of the pack will turn on you. If you can climb a tree or make yourself a pillar to stand on, they should be easy to pick off. If you are low on blocks, digging wolf-killing pits is also a viable strategy, so long as you can manage to push the wolf in. It takes many strikes to fell a healthy wolf, so make sure you have enough clubs to finish the job.

In emergencies, wolves can serve as a source of meat. Beware, however, that wolves do not always drop meat on death.

Like all animals, wolves have to eat to survive. If all prey in a wolf's range are depleted, it will eventually starve to death. Starvation is 

***Surviving the Desert***

Blessing from above:
It cannot rain in the desert. This means that campfires and torches do not need to be covered, so your shelter does not need to have a roof. Spiders will still pose a threat, but these can be avoided by giving the walls of your encampment a lip to prevent spiders from climbing over.

Village Misfortune:
You would think an abandoned village would be an oasis in the desert, but they are not very useful unless a forest is nearby. Unline plains villages, no wood is used in its construction whatsoever, so there is nothing to salvage.

-Clay-

Survival Trick, Digging for Clay:
If you are unsure if what you are digging beneath the water's surface is clay or pure dirt, use your ears. Clay makes a muddy, squelching noise when you hit it. Dirt makes a drier, crunchier sound. This can be useful when diggi
