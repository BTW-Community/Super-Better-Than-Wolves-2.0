In Minecraft, you start with nothing but your bare hands and about ten minutes of daylight. After ten minutes, the sun sets and the monsters come out to play. If you are caught outside after dark, you will in all likelihood be eaten alive. Even if you do manage to fight your way through the night and survive, you will be so exhausted come morning that starvation will be inevitable. 

Surviving your first night in one piece takes planning, cunning, and a little bit of luck. It is easy to get overwhelmed, but Don't Panic! If you stay calm and stick to a solid gameplan, you will survive and thrive.

A successful first day strategy can be broken down into three basic parts.

1: Gather fuel
