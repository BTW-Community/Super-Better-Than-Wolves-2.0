In Minecraft, you start with nothing but your bare hands and about ten minutes of daylight. After ten minutes, the sun sets and the monsters come out to play.

If you are caught outside after dark, you will in all likelihood be eaten alive. Even if you do manage to fight your way through the night and survive, you will be so exhausted that starvation will be inevitable come morning. 

Surviving your first night in Better Than Wolves takes planning, cunning, and a little bit of luck. It is easy to get overwhelmed, but *Don't Panic!* If you stay calm and stick to a solid gameplan, you will survive and thrive.

A successful first day strategy can be broken down into three basic parts, FOOD, FUEL, AND SECURITY.

MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR DAY 1:

Step 1: Hunt for food

~~~~~~STEP 1: HUNTING FOR FOOD~


	No matter what, if you run out of food to eat, you will starve and die. Keeping yourself fed is your top priority in Better Than Wolves, and forgetting this essential fact will always lead to trouble down the road.

Minecraft animals might be stupid, but they aren't going to let you 

~Poisonous Forage~

These mushrooms will not make you big and strong, nor will they give you interesting visions. Red mushrooms will only poison you. That said, poison can never actually kill you, so for the price of hearts you can fill your stomach just a smidge. 

It is not recommended that you eat red mushrooms at all when you can afford it, but especially don't eat them when you are already weakened or hungry. If you have plenty of hearts, however, lining your stomach in exchange for a few moments of poisoning might provide a buffer against starvation down the line.
