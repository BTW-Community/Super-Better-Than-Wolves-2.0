*COWS*

Cows are gentle herbivores that amble lazilly in search of fresh pastures to graze. In order to support their massive bulk, cows are constantly eating. In fact, a herd of these bovines could clear an entire field of grass in a few days!

Though generally tame, it is best not to spook a cow. Their powerful legs can deliver deadly kicks from behind, and, despite their immense size, an enraged cow can cover a lot of ground quickly. This makes cows much harder to hunt than other animals, though the prize of taking one down is sometimes worth the risk. Cows hold within themselves a surplus of food and crafting material. The beef within a cow is extremely nourishing, and their hides can be cut to make leather armor. Finally, the bones of a cow are hard enough to craft a pickaxe out of, which will grant you the ability to break solid stone and mine for ore.

If you want to hunt a cow, it is best for your health to trap it in a pit or take it down from a distance with a bow. A cow doesn't need to be killed, however, to benefit the player. A man can survive on milk for days, and cows are happy to provide their milk to anyone with a bucket. If the udder is engorged, then the cow is holding plenty of delicious milk to harvest. Take heed: do not try to milk a cow that doesn't have a full udder! It bothers them to be poked and prodded.

Thanks to their hardy nature and tough hooves, cows can survive a night of monster attacks better than most animals. If the zombies had any brains, they'd leave these bovines alone.
