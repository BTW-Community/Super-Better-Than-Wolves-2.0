Article: Games as Story Engines

Video Games are a natural extension of human creativity. We can use them to express ourselves and create stories. To liken video games to movies or books, however, doesn't complete the picture. The act of playing a video game is more akin to acting or writing. The game world itself can be like a stage or a set within which the people playing them ("players") can enter new worlds.

Some video games create worlds that are more malleable to open-ended play/roleplay/acting than others. 

Usually when I and other interested parties talk about open-ended games like Minecraft, we refer to it as a "sandbox." 

Some games offer sandboxes in which more creative players are allowed to roam and play without strict rules, timelimits, or intrusive cutscenes. Here is an example from my childhood: When I was a kid, my friends and I were obsessed with a game called Kirby Air Ride. It is a unique racing game in which players ride hovercrafts ("ships") around race tracks laden with traps, monsters, and power ups. Racing was only one portion of the game, however. Another mode, City Trial, instead puts the players into a cityscape with randomly placed power ups, upgrades, and ships. The players only have a few minutes to explore and prepare themselves, because when the timer hits zero, an event match starts. The events can be anything from races to flight tests to all out battle royal gauntlets. FREE TRIAL LETS YOU JUST CHILL AND FLY AROUND AND PLAY WITH UP TO 4 FRIENDS.

Even in games without a specialized sandbox mode, it is possible to use the game engine to just play. 

DARK SOULS BEFORE THERE WAS DARK SOULS: Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, choosing a door and getting lost, like a funhouse with an endless interconnected labarynth. 

I used to go to a specific spot on Kirby and the Mouse DS game with the little digger rabbit and I would dig a burrow and play around.

NOTES:
Definition: Environmentally concious play- gameplay that makes the player aware of the environment within the game world and allows them to impact and change it. Can this make players more aware of the real world environment around them?

KIRBY AIRRIDE WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER IF THE CITY TRIAL LOOPED FOREVER!!!! KEEPING YOUR UPGRADES AND SUCH BETWEEN EACH ROUND!!!!!! AND WHAT IF CERTAIN AREAS HAD "aura" LOCATIONS THAT BUILT UP A CERTAIN RESOURCE FOR PLAYERS TO FIGHT OVER (rather than it being inconsequential random events)
